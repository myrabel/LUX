Data Science Project
Movie Dataset Exploration and Visualization
dataset used is from Kaggle available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/payamamanat/imbd-dataset
Steps:
1. Download data from Kaggle - came in CSV format
2. Load relevant libraries for Exploration i.e. Pandas and Matplotlib
3. Load data using pandas and check the structure and information - number of rows, columns, data types
4. clean the data - this involves dropping nulls, removing blanks or replacing them with mean/mode values and formatting the data as needed to ensue it is usable
5. I split the data into movies and series by checking the duration a.k.a runtime to ensure we get a better trend analysis
6. Find patterns/trends that can be visualized e.g.
-top 10 movies by rating
-top 10 series by rating
-top 10 genres overall
-movie production trends over the years
Visualize these trends using matplotlib - bar graphs and line chart
7. Re-create the same dashboard using Power BI to make a more interactive dashboard and one that is easy on the eyes. - Check list of files
