Week 4: Python Proficiency and Data Structures

This week’s tasks are designed to assess your understanding of key Python concepts, particularly focusing on data structures, list comprehensions, and the implementation of specific algorithms.

1.Palindrome Check Using a Stack
Implementing a Python program to determine whether a given string is a palindrome, using a stack as the primary data structure. The focus here is on correctly applying the stack’s LIFO (Last In, First Out) property to solve the problem.

2.List Comprehension in Python
Provide an explanation of list comprehensions in Python, including at least three practical examples. This task aims to evaluate your ability to utilize Python’s powerful and concise syntax for creating and manipulating lists efficiently.

3Understanding Compound Data Types
Explain what compound data types are in Python, supported by three examples. The goal is to demonstrate your comprehension of data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries, which can store multiple elements.

4.Generating Bigrams from a String
Write a function that processes a string and outputs a list of bigrams. This task emphasizes your ability to work with text data and generate meaningful pairs of adjacent elements.

5.Finding the Closest Key in a Dictionary
Develop a function called `closest_key` that, given a dictionary where the keys are letters and values are lists of letters, identifies the key whose list contains the value closest to the beginning. This problem tests your skills in dictionary manipulation and search algorithms.
